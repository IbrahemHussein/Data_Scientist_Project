This project revolves around predicting whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit based on a telemarketing campaign. The dataset used is derived from the UCI Bank Marketing dataset, enriched with additional social and economic attributes from a country with a population of around 10 million, published by Banco de Portugal.
